# osu-taiko-video-resizer

[original tool](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1129583?n=1) made by Khoo Hao Yit and Jerry, linux native script by velamy :3 
 
basic tutorial:

- open your terminal in the root directory (the one with script.sh)

- type <pre> ``` ./script.sh (video).mp4 ``` </pre> with (video) being the filename of the video you would want to resize. if the video extension is anything other than .mp4 you will have to rename that accordingly.

do note that the storyboard implementation bat file will not work, but if someone wants that working let me know. 

more info can be found in the `i need help!!.txt` file, if there are any issues or you really, REALLY need help i can be contacted on [osu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15538779) or on discord @velamy :)
