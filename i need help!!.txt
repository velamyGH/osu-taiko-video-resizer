basic tutorial as well as common issues that i can think of and how to fix them yay

open your terminal in this location. you can most likely right click in an empty space, and click something along the lines of "Open Terminal Here", if not then type `cd /(path)/osu!taiko\ Video\ Resizer/` with (path) being wherever you downloaded this to

once you are in the directory, you can type `./script.sh (video).mp4` with (video) being the filename (if your video is not mp4 then you will have to rename the file extension accordingly)

done! your video should be in the root as output.mp4 :)


issues:

if the file does not execute, you may need to type `chmod +x script.sh` to make it executable.

any other questions can be dmed to me at velamy on osu or discord :3 <3
